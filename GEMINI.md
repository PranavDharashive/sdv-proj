I. Core Automation Framework:
   1. Single Command/Minimal Steps: Create an automation solution for installation and configuration.
   2. Cleanup Scripts: Provide scripts for cleanup if installation fails or for general teardown.
   3. Target Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
   4. Logging: Store all execution logs into a single file.
   5. Documentation: Create a README.md file detailing prerequisites and execution steps.
   6. Kube-apiserver Endpoint Input: Prompt for the private IP address of the Kube-apiserver endpoint during installation.
   7. Final Success Message: Display a summary of successfully deployed components upon completion.

  II. Kubernetes Cluster Setup:
   1. Kubeadm Prerequisites:
       * Setup kubeadm prerequisites.
       * Consider containerd as the container runtime and also I want to setup docker runtime both on this single node, i want to run docker for other apps and containerd for kubernetes, make sure that docker and container both will be running and using "systemd" as a cgroup driver for both
       * Include specific commands: sudo swapoff -a, sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab, sudo tee
         /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf, sudo modprobe overlay, sudo modprobe br_netfilter, sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf, sudo
         sysctl --system.
   2. Single Node Cluster: Setup a kubeadm single-node cluster.
   3. Kubernetes Version: Install Kubernetes version 1.31 for kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl.
   4. CNI Plugin: Use Calico CNI instead of Flannel.
   5. Node Taint Removal: Ensure the node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule taint is removed from the control plane node so
      applications can be deployed on it. The taint removal step should be idempotent (skipped if already removed).
   6. Kubeconfig Configuration: Configure kubeconfig for the current user running Ansible, not just root.

  III. Application Deployments & Verification:
   1. Monitoring Stack:
       * Install Prometheus Node Exporter on the VM.
       * Deploy Prometheus and Grafana on k8s in the monitoring namespace.
       * Verify Node Exporter setup.
       * Verify monitoring stack deployment.
   2. Redis Service:
       * Create an sdv namespace.
       * Deploy a single-pod Redis service with its Kubernetes service in the sdv namespace.
       * Verify Redis setup.
   3. MySQL Service:
       * Create /mnt/mysql-db-data/ directory on the VM.
       * Create a local storage class named sdv-local-storage.
       * Deploy MySQL on k8s using PV and PVC with the sdv-local-storage class.
       * Verify MySQL setup, create sdv_data database, create user sdvuser with password abcd1234, grant all privileges, and flush privileges.
       * Specific handling for PV/PVC: Ensure nodeAffinity is correctly templated and handled for local PVs, with graceful failure and user
         instructions if an immutable PV is encountered.
   4. SDV Application:
       * Deploy an sdv application using nginx:latest image and its Kubernetes service in the sdv namespace.
       * Verify sdv app deployment.
   5. SDV Nginx/Frontend Application:
       * Deploy an Nginx/frontend app using nginx:latest image with a NodePort service in the sdv namespace.
       * Verify SDV Nginx/frontend app deployment.
   6. MinIO Service:
       * Create /mnt/minio-storage/ directory.
       * Create a minio namespace.
       * Deploy MinIO on k8s with a local volume and its Kubernetes service.
       * Specific handling for PV/PVC: Ensure nodeAffinity is correctly templated and handled for local PVs, with graceful failure and user
         instructions if an immutable PV is encountered.
   7. General Verification: All pod status checks should be robust, including checking status.containerStatuses[0].ready.

  IV. Cleanup Script Enhancements:
   1. Kubernetes Package Removal: Unhold and remove kubeadm, kubectl, kubelet packages, allowing changes to held packages.
   2. Directory Removal: Remove /etc/kubernetes, $HOME/.kube, /var/lib/etcd, /etc/containerd, and /etc/cni directories.
   3. Persistent Data Exclusion: Do NOT remove /mnt/mysql-db-data/ and /mnt/minio-storage/ directories.
   4. Iptables Flush: Flush iptables rules (iptables -F && iptables -t nat -F && iptables -t mangle -F && iptables -X).

  This comprehensive set of requirements has guided the development of the Ansible playbooks and helper scripts.
